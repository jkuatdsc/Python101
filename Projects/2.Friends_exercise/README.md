### A simple python exercise to demonstrate copying files
    --Create two text files (people.txt) & (nearby.txt)
    --Create a friends.py file
    --Ask the user to enter three friends
    --Check if the friends are in the people.txt file
    --If they are, copy them to the nearby.txt file
####That's it
